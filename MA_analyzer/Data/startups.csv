We wanted to let them save words directly into this app which would automatically pull up translations, images, definitions, pronunciation—all the things you may need to study the vocab. And after that, you'd be able to practice the vocab using a bunch of spaced repetition-powered learning modes—similarly to Quizlet, Anki, and others. \n\nDifference to Anki, Quizlet, etc: saving words in those apps is kinda tedious. You need to fill out both sides of the flashcard—original, translation, transcription, image, etc—all by yourself. It means you'd need to translate the word you want to save first. We removed these last steps in this mobile app. It translates words for you, suggests definitions, images, etc. Learning is similar—you go through words and the app reminds you to repeat those you haven't memorized well or haven't repeated recently. The good old spaced repetition algorithm.\n\nDifference to Duolingo, Memrise, etc: those apps build their own curriculum that you have to follow. This mobile app tailors to your needs. You're in control of what to learn. It also lets you create decks (lists) where you can save words that you want to practice in the future. It will only \"teach\" you what you saved yourself. It can be vocab from your language class, Netflix series, important words or phrases for your upcoming trip, anything. \n\nThis app was priced at $7.99 one-time on the App Store. It's only available for iPhone and iPad. We decided to shut it down on March 31st and made it free. You have a chance to save it from the shutdown! In the last year, it was used by around 1,500 people monthly. When we announced the shutdown, users were very sour which proves that the app is very loved by the modest amount of users we managed to attract since the initial launch.\n\nReason for sale: our other project, Mate Translate, has been showing spectacular growth over the last years.
