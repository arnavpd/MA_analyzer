I run PPC and often big in prime Day or Boxing days. In average, I dedicate 1-2h/week but couple more hours of commitment would help very much ( key word research/readjustment, PPC, etc). I run promo very often which get the price to my main concurrent price, so a well done PPC will increase drastically sales.\n\nCustomers\n- They are from various demographics but generally adults, tech enthusiast, parents, women, sport enthusiast etc. Currently only from US.\n\nFinancials\n- With a solid budget to order bigger quantity and timely replenishment (this is what explain couple of month of very slow sale or no sale as i had, cf financials). There are few months with very low of no sales due to very extended time lead as COVID effect. \n\nAdditional Notes\n- Designed LOGO and HIGH quality images;\n- Great seller and product reviews.\n- Great best selling products",

Fyi, once we hit over 30k in profit when we had a physical store in Korea. \n2 years ago, we had to move out of Korea due to family health issues, Korea is a very high polluted country since 2017, so we are now living in the Sumatran jungle to rest our lungs. This also means we are restarting our project from distance.\n\nWe have 15 formulations in total that have been tested in the market in Korea. All those 15 have been well-tested by our customers between 2013~2019. All the formulators can make formulas, but to create a set of unique formulas, it will take years of research and testing it out to the market. The formulation is like making donuts, you have to prove it several times to make the formula that works as planned. You can see the prototype of the products here: https://fridaskincare.com/fridaskincare-legacy-products/ and don't forget to click on each image to read the honest reviews we succeeded to collect during our prototyping phase. \n\nEarly this year, 2 of those prototypes have been manufactured and we are actually wanting to partner with the sales-marketing team to penetrate the worldwide market. We plan to launch all of them in order once we could hit RoI from our current 2 serums.\n\nWe are thinking of either one of these scenarios to be a reality:\n1. meet a buyer who want to groom the brand as is and has a willingness to grow it far and beyond,\n2. meet a partner who wants to take over the sales-marketing dept, and be our exclusive partner (we are terrible in this field).\n\nOr if you have something else in mind, don't hesitate, and let's chat it out!",

People send pictures when paying →  we get back with a verdict ('fake' or 'real' + a list of reasons). *This is a manual service! But properly documented*\n\nWe charge $20 to $100 per item. Besides, we charge $60 for a Certificate of Authenticity, which helps people get their money back from a scam. The Certificate is trusted by banks (chargebacks), PayPal, eBay, etc (we've got a 99% success rate, and we guarantee it).\n\nREVENUE-WISE: MicroAcquire might have a limit, thus not getting the full revenue of May, but here’s a Stripe-verified chart with a bigger + clearer picture, including the COVID boost we’ve had\n\nhttps://www.indiehackers.com/product/legit-check-by-ch/revenue\n\nHowever, May 2020 to May 2021, we made ~$210,000 in revenue. Ultimately, the asking price multiple reflects the revenue today, but mainly the potential in the audience’s numbers.\n\nYou’d be buying:\n- SEO Moat: 7,000,000 all-time uniques, fast-indexing articles at top positions in the search page.\n- Domain Authority: 68\n- All content written so far may only need an update every 6-18 months, but once it’s written, it keeps bringing in traffic\n- A head start in a growing market\n- High-value intent customers - readers, given the topic of our articles, are already willing to spend, and are willing to spend on high-value items\n- High margins, as it's a digital service. At the end of the day, the output is a text message\n- Low time cost for the authenticators (an authentication can take as little as 15 seconds)\n- VERY trusted brand by consumers, cleanest reputation out of the competitors. B2B-wise, trusted by: Bank of America, MBNA, PayPal, eBay, Poshmark, Chase, etc\n- Got iOS/Android app →  hundreds of thousands of downloads\n- A SaaS product for people who resell - an inventory management tool. Very bare minimum, no paying customers (no PMF), but that’s a head start for a working product (beautiful one as well, technically sound), and I can point to some products in the market that make 7 digits per year, which validate a need\n- A “Price Comparison” app - technically sound, beautiful. We fell short in connecting it properly to the written content\n- Email list of 15k+\n- A framework for writing content\n- 1k+ YouTube channel subscribers, $100-$150 per month ad revenue\n- 8,500 Instagram Followers\n- 1k+ Pinterest followers, 500k views/mo\n- Already-signed partnerships with StockX, GOAT, Farfetch Middle-East, FlightClub\n",

We have never utilized PPC services. \n\nTo continue the growth of FreshAir I would allocate capital to generate a large unit order, send it to a fulfillment center and run PPC ads. Upon the sale, you will receive distributor, manufacture and all applicable contacts.\n\nFrom the beginning, we understood that just being another automotive freshener wasn't enough to be a leader in this space. We knew the importance of building a brand and products that were unique to the market. \n\nFreshAir is currently living at the intersection of Adventure, Curiosity and Creativity. These three archetypes have given our brand a unique value system that relates to a demographic. These three archetypes are the main directon for FreshAir, all future marketing and product development will fit these values. Natural products that are inspired by nature for the adventurer (offroad vehicles). Opulent products for the rebel are inspired by the city (Auto Enthusiasts). Creative products that are designed with talented artists around the globe to create charitable donations to organizations of the artists' choice (Artists of all kinds). \n\nThere is a lot of gas left in FreshAir and we would love to see it grow into maturity. \n\nThe vision is to outsource distribution and focus strictly on brand building, marketing and product development. \n\nUpon purchase, you will receive all assets owned by FreshAir.

          "about": "Crypto exchange platform featuring cryptocurrency trading and takes fees. It safely deposit, withdraw, convert or trade your cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, BCH, and even most of the major altcoins not found on most streamlined exchanges. \n\nThe product is a fully functioning cryptocurrency exchange platform. The administrator of the platform will be able to generate unique safe wallets under their own control (I will provide instructions upon delivery).\nObjectives: Users will be able to sign up and transfer their cryptocurrency assets to the site via the blockchain. Users will be able to sell their cryptocurrency assets on the site for Tether (USDT) which is known to be a cryptocurrency that holds value equivalent to a US Dollar. They can do many things with their Tether. \n1) They may withdraw this Tether or any cryptocurrency to any external wallets via the blockchain network.\n2) They may use the Tether to purchase other cryptocurrency tokens whenever they feel like it. \n\nProfitability: The platform is able to charge set fees when a user decides to trade his/her cryptocurrency assets. For example, if the platform fee is 2% and a user buys $100USDT worth of Bitcoin, they will receive $98USDT worth of Bitcoin when they place a buy order for Bitcoin. The profits the exchange receives will be this 2%, and this fee percentage may be changed by the exchange administrator. The 2% fee will be instantly internally transferred to the administrator account’s wallet which may then be withdrawn to an external address. \n\nLacks: Bit license, needs it to be setup. \n\nThere will only ever be 512,375,095 Runixcoin tokens in existence. The Runixcoin token’s value is anchored to revenue from the Runixcoin Exchange (https://www.runixcoin.com) which is the easiest, most reliable, and safest crypto exchange in the world. Runixcoin tokens are a fork of the Stellar Lumens (XLM) network and run on it, providing the same safety and security as the XLM.

          "about": "eCommerce brand with $200,000 in TTM revenue and $100,000 in TTM profit that is the world's smallest and only smart plug on the planet that is fully voice agnostic (works with Siri, Alexa, OK Google, and IFTTT). Control your home from your phone with the app and every major voice assistant.\n\n✅ $200,000 in TTM revenue (19/20)\n✅ $100,000 in TTM profit (19/20)\n✅ $16,000 in revenue last month (19/20)\n✅ $8,000 in profit last month (19/20)\n✅ MFI (Apple) Compliant\n✅ UK Manufacturer\n✅ Competitors: Eve Smart Home, Opro 9\n\nWe have shipped over 30,000 smart plugs to over 16,000 paying customers in over 100 countries! (people use travel adaptors because our open API tech is so unique).\n\nOur USP is our open API for developers. \nThe infrastructure is built on Amazon AWS IOT, we have built our own custom dashboards and tech support for this product.\n\nWe are about to launch our brand new WIFIPLUG 2.0 this year and already have 000’s of plugs on pre order. \n \nFW - FreeRTOS\nRated good on trustpilot 350+ reviews (room for improvement here) \nAndroid 10,000+ downloads\niOS apps 20,000+ downloads \nBoth built on Xamarin (one developer to keep costs down)\n\nFull documentation available on GitHub. \n\nNote - this is not a dropshipping company that we just stick our logo on and someone else makes the stock and the apps.\n\nThis is a full blown company. All the tech and IP is owned in house. This would not suit a dropshipper as there is frequent tech maintenance required along with real time chat support.\n\nIt could be a lot more hands off by using 3PL warehouse to ship or a distributor, you could outsource tech support and even outsource the tech stack but my team are developers so it makes sense to utilise them. \n\nWe are now working in the B2B space with a none competing product (leveraging our experience with this startup). \n\nTo build this startup from scratch would cost you (easily) £1M - we have invested 40,000+ dev hours and the brand has a 10 year goodwill value (with trademark).\n\nThere is an opportunity to buy not build and leapfrog the competition. We are the only UK smart plug with open API and full Voice control - this gets us a lot of attention and frequent enquiries to build out white label services. \n\nRevenue is from pre lockdown when we had stock and shipped 100% organically. \n\nRevenue since lockdown is really\nLow, $30k in pre orders for our latest smart plug (launching Q3/Q4 this year). If we had stock at the beginning of lockdown we would be in a very different place right now. ",

Simply now you can't receive any add to cart, check out, purchase and other events if you are using iOS 14 of Safari. That trend for data protection is already accepted by Google Chrome and other browsers, so in the near future you can lose up to 60% of all pixel events. No doubt advertising will be less effective, ROI/ROAS lower and businesses will suffer a lot.\n\nALPHA can help to solve this problem.ALPHA will update your current pixel (Don't need to set up a new one) and setup Facebook Conversion API to track all general events on iOS 14 update and future versions of iOS and Mac OS. So if you set up Conversion API tracking from your website, you still be able to receive all pixel events and run conversion optimization ads.\n\nThis shopify app is the solution to a lot of merchants that rely of FB as their primary source to drive traffic to their online store. This app has a lot of potiential especially with the results seen with Shopify App Store ads. So the new buyer will have an immediate source of scaling the business immediately. Due to lack of time support has been neglected, hence the negative reviews relating to support. \n\nThe new owner of the application will have 3 months of free bug fixing.",

Existing and potential future clients range from mid-size industrial services companies to large Enterprise industrial clients such as Utilities, Oil & Gas, Pulp & Paper, Chemicals, etc.\n\n✅ $62,525 in TTM revenue\n✅ $6,725 in revenue last month\n✅ $1,944 in profit last month\n✅ Competitors: SalesForce Field Service, Maximo Mobile\n\nThe platform is served as a cloud-based mobile and web application. We are currently adding several major new features to the platform and are in discussions with a major client which would potentially double our recurring revenues in the next year. 2021 Annual growth rate was 180%. We are finishing up various admin/management improvements to allow the next owner to scale and grow to more customers without needing to run custom scripts or spend a lot of time setting up new customers. We have mostly been reinvesting profits into the development of new features.\n\nSo far there has been little effort placed on sales and marketing, with the majority of revenue coming from word-of-mouth and organic growth (existing customers expanding operations and adding additional users).",

          "about": "Mobile App with $7,500 in ARR and $12,700 in TTM revenue that quickly saves your own vocabulary and learns it using spaced repetition, practice spelling, and pronunciation. We created this startup to take on Anki, Quizlet, & co. \n\n✅ $7,500 in ARR\n✅ $12,700 in TTM revenue\n✅ $7,560 in TTM profit\n✅ $685 in revenue last month\n✅ $927 in profit last month\n✅ Competitors: Quizlet, iTranslate Lingo, Anki\n\nWe decided we could make a better flashcard app that would eventually let people get rid of notebooks they're using to write down new vocabulary while practicing a foreign language. We wanted to let them save words directly into this app which would automatically pull up translations, images, definitions, pronunciation—all the things you may need to study the vocab. And after that, you'd be able to practice the vocab using a bunch of spaced repetition-powered learning modes—similarly to Quizlet, Anki, and others. \n\nDifference to Anki, Quizlet, etc: saving words in those apps is kinda tedious. You need to fill out both sides of the flashcard—original, translation, transcription, image, etc—all by yourself. It means you'd need to translate the word you want to save first. We removed these last steps in this mobile app. It translates words for you, suggests definitions, images, etc. Learning is similar—you go through words and the app reminds you to repeat those you haven't memorized well or haven't repeated recently. The good old spaced repetition algorithm.\n\nDifference to Duolingo, Memrise, etc: those apps build their own curriculum that you have to follow. This mobile app tailors to your needs. You're in control of what to learn. It also lets you create decks (lists) where you can save words that you want to practice in the future. It will only \"teach\" you what you saved yourself. It can be vocab from your language class, Netflix series, important words or phrases for your upcoming trip, anything. \n\nThis app was priced at $7.99 one-time on the App Store. It's only available for iPhone and iPad. We decided to shut it down on March 31st and made it free. You have a chance to save it from the shutdown! In the last year, it was used by around 1,500 people monthly. When we announced the shutdown, users were very sour which proves that the app is very loved by the modest amount of users we managed to attract since the initial launch.\n\nReason for sale: our other project, Mate Translate, has been showing spectacular growth over the last years. We want to laser-focus on it and make it the #1 translation software on the market.",

Right now the total lifetime revenue from this SAAS has been $194,000.\n\nDo you have a financial summary or P&L? Ideally one that includes at least revenue, operating profit, and net income after tax.\nNot at this moment since I took over on 1-1-2020 and established a brand new LLC to house the company, but I can list everything out pretty easily. This thing is a really low cost bootstrapped business that could turn into an absolute cash cow for the right business owner.

A Health and Skincare Wellness brand hosted on Shopify and provides organic, tested, and pure CBD products to the masses.\n~ CBD is a huge growth industry and you will have a foothold in it.\n~ All you need is to have marketing and advertising funds to make this an overnight success with great ROI.\n~ Pure Hermosa is a gorgeous brand with a great brand story, built and run by a woman in Hermosa Beach, California.\n~ Incredible product with great results that everyone loves - we have rave reviews and loyal, return customers, and effective Influencers who love the brand.\nThe brand has traction and is easy to run with a great manufacturer and drop ship fulfillment partner.\n~ NO MOQ and low COGs with a %67 Net!\n\n✅ $7,065 in TTM revenue\n✅ Competitors: Lord Jones, Charlotte's Web, PureKana\n\nWhat was your last 12-month's revenue? (Trailing 12 Months)\n$13k\n\nWho currently maintains and updates your software?\nWe use Shopify and it's all very simple, turnkey, automated and runs beautifully.  Easily transferable.\n\nWhat was total revenue for 2020?\n$12,345\n\nWho are your top 3 competitors?\nLord Jones, Charlotte's Web, PureKana\n\nHow many customers do you have?\n5300 email list\n\nWhat technology stack is this product built on?\nShopify\n\nDo you have a way of verifying revenue?\nShopify Reports\n\nImportant Note:  We never were able to raise the money you must have for marketing in the CBD industry, due to Covid.  If you have funds for Ad-buying this brand will soar!  I love this brand and built it myself- and I come from marketing and know how to do this, but Covid scared away our investors just when we were ready to grow the company.  Also when Facebook reworked their algorithm and we no longer reached more than 2% of our REAL Followers - organic marketing was not reliable any longer, and sales tanked.  \n\nFinancials\nCovid hit us hard - this company is ready for someone to take it on that has the marketing monies for the reach it needs. When we do pay for ads, we always get more sales, but we are out of money.   For $3k a month, a platform like Mantis runs CBD ads and have case studies with other CBD brands that show 5-6 times ROI.  This is all set up and ready to go!\n\nHappy to share the 3-year FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS and PITCH DECK of years in the making - to show you the huge potential.",

Sale includes marketplace and ownership of all domains in attachments. (Some have sold and are mentioned below.)\n\nThis marketplace has been used by a lot of Web, SaaS, and App startups since the early 2000s. Slack even started with slackhq.com, in fact, it still redirects. It is a popular choice because you can brand your service as \"Shark\" by using sharkhq.com without paying $500K+ for shark.com. \n\nWant to see more examples? Just google \"hq.com\" with the quotes to see hundreds of these domains in use by Apps and SaaS products.\n\nOne of the more famous examples is Basecamp. They built a large business using basecamphq.com because they could not afford the .com. Basecamp only acquired the actual .com many years later. They also wrote a few NYT bestsellers, speak at conferences, and have millions of followers so their idea spread, and other companies started using HQ.com. Getting a short, brandable domain is out of reach these days. The HQ.com pattern allows companies to use a great brand name for a reasonable price and focus on building a business and acquiring customers. \n\nQuick updates since the listing was created: \n✅ Aug 2021\nPillarhq.com sold for $999 so it is no longer included. \nSequencehq.com sold for $1,299 so it is no longer included. \n\n✅ June 2021\nMosaichq.com sold for $1,299 so it is no longer included. \n\n✅ May 2021\nMaximizehq.com sold for $1,000 so it is no longer included. \n\n✅ Feb 2021: \nCowboyHq.com sold for $1,000 so it is no longer included. \n\n\n✅ Updates Jan 22, 2021:\nMagicalhq.com sold in January for $1,500 so it is no longer included. \nReleasehq.com sold in November for $2,500 so it is no longer included. \nChancehq.com was under escrow for $3,500 but the deal fell through.\n\n",

It's been running pretty much on autopilot since I acquired a SaaS business back in February 2020, and I haven’t spent more than an hour a week on this one. I haven't been properly running FB/IG ads since March of 2020, but our products are perfect for social media. I have over a hundred videos and images ready to use.\n\n2. The Amazon Brand Store was set up only in October 2020 and has generated ~$9K in revenue so far.\n\n3. Recently launched a subscription-based iOS workout app with dozens of no-equipment workouts, workouts using our products, 30-day exercise challenges, and a built-in storefront where customers can buy our products. It's a 1.0 version, so there's a lot of room for improvement and further development to make it a very significant revenue stream for this business.\n\nINCLUDED:\n• A highly optimized Shopify store with an average CR of 5.5%.\n• Amazon Brand Store.\n• A custom-built iOS workout app + source code.\n• A registered trademark;\n• Seasoned Google and Facebook ad accounts.\n• All social media, email, tracking, and other related accounts.\n• 100+ product photos and videos; \n• Tested and ready-to-launch social media and Google ads;\n• 100+ exercise videos with our products;\n• ~$3,000 worth of inventory (~$25K in retail prices);\n• Highly optimized backend with cart-abandonment email and SMS sequences, post-purchase upsells, A/B-tested landing pages, etc.;\n\nSocial media accounts:\n• Pinterest ~ 800,000 monthly viewers;\n• Instagram: 10,100 followers;\n• Facebook: 2,300 followers. \n\nEmail and SMS lists:\n• Email list: 19,500 emails (segmented in Klaviyo).\n• SMS list: 22,500 phone numbers (Postscript).\n\nOrder-fulfillment is fully automated with a 3PL fulfillment center in Texas and Amazon FBA.\n \nWe have two great suppliers that know our products' specs and can customize and/or develop new products, so ordering a new batch of products doesn't require much time. I can give enough proven product ideas to a new owner so they wouldn't need to think about product research for a long time. \n\nAn ideal buyer would be someone with an experienced e-commerce team ready to take this business to the next level and realize its full potential or someone who doesn’t want to spend years and hundreds of thousands of dollars by starting from scratch.\n\nWith a strong brand, Shopify store, Amazon brand store, and iOS app, everything's ready to grow this business into a multi-million dollar brand!\n\nNo seller-financing. Not interested in brokers. Looking for a FAST sale (hence the price). Serious inquiries only. Bitcoin and/or Ethereum are accepted.\n\n• LIMITED TIME BONUS OFFER: Buy this business before November 30, and I'll include another Shopify store with $2.35M in lifetime revenue, 71K segmented email list, 3K FB messenger list, and 65K FB followers for FREE.",

We know the software very well and have several clients in Canada and connections in Europe and Australia. While IBM is constantly improving their products and getting more customers, we integrate their software for clients and filling the gaps with TeamOne, including: administration, releases, performance testing, code organization and documentation.\n\nTo give you an idea, one of our competitor's software package bundle for IBM Cognos Analytics costs 500K in licensing for the first year. Their software for IBM Planning Analytics is around 100k. Then they charge some support rate for the subsequent years. TeamOne add-on is for mid to large size companies who already spend at least 200k-500k on IBM software licensing and around 500k-1M on integrating that software (bigger companies, spend a way more on IBM's software). The current version of TeamOne already supports lots of features for IBM Planning Analytics and in the current state we can easily sell it for 20k / client. I know how to implement support for IBM Cognos Analytics and add another 30k to the licensing price. Even at 50k / client it would be a dumping price when comparing to our competitors and actually they will consider buying I expect to sell TeamOne to one of them.\n\nBesides offering our software we also can integrate the mentioned IBM products. An average B2B developer rate is around CAD130-160/hr, when most of the developers are paid CAD70 (mid) -100 (senior/architect). As I mentioned previously, the consulting/implementation is 500k-1M / avg client project.",
